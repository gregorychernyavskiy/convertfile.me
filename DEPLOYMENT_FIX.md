# Serverless Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Database Connection**: Made MongoDB connection optional and non-blocking
2. **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for serverless environments
3. **Dynamic URLs**: Frontend now detects the environment and uses correct API URLs
4. **File System**: Added better error handling for upload directory creation
5. **Environment Variables**: Properly configured for serverless deployment

## Deployment Steps:

### For Vercel:

1. Make sure your environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `NODE_ENV`: production

2. Deploy using Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. Or connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments

### For Other Serverless Platforms:

1. Make sure the `uploads` directory handling is compatible with your platform
2. Some platforms might require using cloud storage (S3, etc.) instead of local file storage
3. Ensure environment variables are properly configured

## Testing:

1. Test locally first: `npm start`
2. Check the health endpoint: `/api/health`
3. Test file upload functionality
4. Verify database connectivity (optional - will work without DB)

## Key Changes Made:

- Added global error handlers
- Made database operations non-critical (app works without DB)
- Dynamic API URL detection in frontend
- Better error messages and logging
- Proper serverless configuration in vercel.json

The app should now work even if MongoDB is unavailable, which is common during serverless cold starts.
